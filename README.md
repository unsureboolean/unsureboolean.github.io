3. Replace it with your newly encrypted key (see encryption instructions in the file comments)
4. Update the `AUTO_UNLOCK_PASSWORD` if needed

### Formspree Contact Form
The contact form uses Formspree for processing. To update or troubleshoot:
1. Log in to your Formspree account
2. Verify the form ID in your dashboard
3. Update the form action URL in `index.html` if needed:
   ```html
   <form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST">
   ```
